### A go toolkit for decoding, encoding icalendar ics ical files

Alpha status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jordic/goics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jordic/goics)

After trying to decode some .ics files and review available go packages, I decided to start writing this pacakge.

First attempt was from a fixed structure, similar to that needed. Later, I started to investigate the format and discovered that it is a pain, and has many variants, depending on who implements it. For this reason I evolved it to a tookit for decode and encode the format.

Examples can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/jordic/goics).


Features implemented:

- Parsing and writing of vevent, not completly.. 
- No recursive events, 
- And no alarms inside events
