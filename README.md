After trying to decode some .ics files and review available go packages, I decided to start writing this pacakge.

First attempt was from a fixed structure, similar to that needed. Later, I started to investigate the format and discovered that it is a pain, and has many variants, depending on who implements it. For this reason I evolved it to a tookit for decode and encode the format.
